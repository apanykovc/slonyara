# `aiogram` 3.4.1 constrains `pydantic` to versions `<2.6`.  As of Python
# 3.13 this range no longer ships pre-built Windows wheels for
# `pydantic-core`, so `pip` will attempt to compile the Rust extension.
# That requires both the Rust toolchain (cargo) **and** the Microsoft
# Visual C++ build tools with the MSVC compiler and a Windows SDK so that
# `cl.exe`, `link.exe` and headers like `io.h` are available.  Ensure the
# toolchains are installed and on `PATH` before installing dependencies on
# Windows, or use Python 3.12 where wheels are still published.
