# `aiogram` 3.4.1 constrains `pydantic` to versions `<2.6`.  As of Python
# 3.13 this range no longer ships pre-built Windows wheels for
# `pydantic-core`, so `pip` will attempt to compile the Rust extension.
# That requires both the Rust toolchain (cargo) **and** the Microsoft Visual
# C++ build tools that provide `link.exe`.  Make sure both toolchains are
# available before installing the dependencies on Windows, or use Python
# 3.12 where wheels are still published.
