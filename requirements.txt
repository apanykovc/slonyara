# `aiogram` 3.4.1 constrains `pydantic` to versions `<2.6`.  On Python 3.13
# there are no pre-built Windows wheels for `pydantic-core`, so `pip`
# compiles the Rust extension.  Make sure both toolchains are ready *before*
# installing dependencies:
#   • Rust toolchain (cargo) from https://rustup.rs/.
#   • Microsoft C++ Build Tools / Visual Studio "Desktop development with C++"
#     workload, with MSVC v143 (or newer), a Windows 10/11 SDK, and optionally
#     the C++ CMake tools so `link.exe`, `cl.exe`, and headers like `io.h` are
#     on `PATH`.
# If installing the Microsoft toolchain is not possible, use Python 3.12 where
# pre-built wheels are still published.
